# Zybo Linux Base System
<aside class="warning">
This is for the OLD Zybo System (SKU: 410-279, Zybo Zynq-7000)
</aside>

This contains all of my work creating a base linux system from scratch. This has vga and audio support. Newer version of the kernel do not work with the ASoC audio of the zybo, need to look into that.
